Your project proposal looks pretty good, but I think that just implementing acceleration structures is a little bit lightweight on scope for a final project. Implementing one acceleration structure would be the sort of thing I'd hope to see as the milestone 1 deliverable rather than the final product. Looking into level-of-detail algorithms could fill this out a little, but I'd need to have a little more concrete idea of what you plan to deliver for that. I think most LOD methods for triangle meshes rely on mesh simplification, which is definitely an interesting direction you could explore. I'm also open to other ideas for how to widen the scope a bit. Please submit a revised project proposal by 11:59pm on Wednesday 2/24, and feel free to chat with me in office hours before then if you'd like to talk through ideas with me.

Follow-up: revised proposal commited to project repo by 11:59 on Wednesday, 2/24.
